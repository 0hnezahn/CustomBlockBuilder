# CustomBlockBuilder
The Custom Block Builder plugin bypasses Minecraft's standard 16-pixel grid limitations, allowing for extremely precise block placement, sometimes up to 1/10,000th of a block. It achieves this by using the hitbox of boats placed on invisible armor stands and then overlaying them with blocks. This technique enables precise parkour setups and advanced builds without needing mods, running entirely server-side. Only for 1.16.5 and higher versions.
